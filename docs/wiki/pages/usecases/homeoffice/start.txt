During the Corona Lockdown, we experience some of the severe limitations of remote work. Usually, even when working remote most of the time, we occasionally work in the office, or we at least drop in for a coffee and smalltalk.

There is a very important aspect of this presence in an real office space: it allows for incidental interaction. People drop by at your desk or you drop into a colleague from another office location who drops by after a customer meeting in your town. You certainly call each other or schedule a video conference, but this does not compensate the lack of these incidental interactions. The scheduled meetings are work, the incidents are fun.

And often enough, it is the incidental talk that leads to the most productive and creative outcomes.

Podium can be used as a technical means to enable incidental interaction. Other than traditional video conferencing tools, you can open your personal video room and leave it open an accessible as long as you like -- without any hourly or per-session fee by any conferencing provider.
